Wrapper offline is a software designed to provide readily obtainable, irrevocable access to GoAnimate's retired assets in the modern era    
It achieves this by replicating the original API and asset servers entirely on the user's computer while providing a simplistic frontend to interact with them    
This project is important for archival purposes, as the ability to use the legacy GoAnimate editor and themes would be far trickier without it

## THIS IS A VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE WITH BUGFIXES

## Building and testing
To run Wrapper offline with a development server, first run this command
```
npm install
```
Then create a build
```
npm run build
```
And now you can run the development server with
```
npm run dev
```
### Packaging
To build a full copy of Wrapper offline
```
npm run package
```
This is a ready-made version. You just need to run Wrapper offline in the folder the package creator just made based on your computer's architecture    
Since I only have `Linux` and `Windows` installed, you need to build the `macOS` versions manually

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want
FFmpeg is under the GNU GPLv2 license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. Flash player (`resources/extensions`) and GoAnimate's original assets (`resources/static`) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist

## Credits
These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper offline, except [octanuary](https://github.com/octanuary)***
