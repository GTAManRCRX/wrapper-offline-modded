# Wrapper offline
Wrapper offline is a GoAnimate server emulator carrying on the torch of [VisualPlugin's GoAnimate Wrapper project](https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper) after its shutdown in 2020. Unlike the original project, Wrapper offline can not be shut down by Vyond.   
Why? It's because everything is hosted and programmed to function locally, no internet access required, barring the initial download (and TTS at this time).   
This project is important for archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be far trickier without it.   
Besides the main feature of Wrapper offline, the original creators added other additional features and improvements compared to the original GoAnimate Wrapper project, and there will be more to come as they implement more and more features

## THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE!!!  
IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE ORIGINAL VERSION, GET IT FROM THIS LINK: [Wrapper offline](https://github.com/wrapper-offline/wrapper-offline.git)

## Running
This is the Linux version of Wrapper offline, therefore if you use Windows, you have to make your own build manually  
## Building  
In order to build, use the `npm run build` command after you cloned this repository  
## Importing stuff  
If you want to import videos and characters from other instances of Wrapper offline, open its folder and drag the "_SAVED" and "_ASSETS" folder into the Wrapper offline folder. If you have already made any videos or characters, this will not work. Please only import on a new install with no saved characters or videos, or take the folders in Wrapper offline out before dragging the old one in. If you want to import character IDs from the original LVM, you can click on CREATE A CHARACTER in the video list, scroll down to "Copy a character", and type in a character ID.

## Updates & Support
For support, the first thing you should do is to head over the original creators' [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kf7BzSw)  
As only the original version gets official support, therefore don't expect any for this fork

## Dependencies
This program relies on Flash and Node.js to work properly. Luckily, they require no download, as they have already been included in Wrapper offline.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
This includes:
  - Files in the "wrapper" folder
  - Batch files made for Wrapper offline
  - Node.js

FFmpeg is under the GNU GPLv2 license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. Flash Player (extensions folder) and GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist.

**Please do not contact anyone directly on the list for support, use the Discord server.**

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper offline.***
